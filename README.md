## ‚ùì FAQ

### Which IntelliJ-based IDEs are supported?

OpenInTools supports all IntelliJ-based IDEs, including IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, PyCharm, PhpStorm, and others.

### Is the Xcode integration available on Windows or Linux?

No, the Xcode integration is only available on macOS, as Xcode itself is a macOS-exclusive application.

### How does OpenInTools detect my installed tools?

The plugin automatically searches for common installation paths for VS Code, Cursor, and Xcode. If your installation is in a non-standard location, you can manually set the path in the plugin settings.

Currently, OpenInTools opens the entire project folder in VS Code and Cursor. For Xcode, you can select specific .xcworkspace or .xcodeproj files from the dropdown menu.
